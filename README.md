# ECE_325_directed_graph
a repo created for UIUC ece 325 course development
First, run the python file, it will generate a directed graph with n nodes, n could be changed by changing graph_Gen.py -> node_num
        it will store the node list in nodes.txt and the edge list in edges.txt, using messy_edges.txt as a temp.
Then, the main.c file would use nodes.txt and edges.txt to generate a graph and returns the number of mother vertices in the graph.
